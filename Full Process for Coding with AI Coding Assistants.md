 2. Consider which guidelines are relevant to the task.
 3. Plan your approach using the relevant guidelines.
 4. Execute your plan, adhering to all applicable guidelines.
 5. Review your response to ensure it aligns with the guidelines.

‚∏ª

üìú Comprehensive Guidelines

1. Core Principles
 ‚Ä¢ Sequential Thinking: Break down tasks into logical steps. Document your thought process before writing code. Use the sequential-thinking tool for complex tasks.
 ‚Ä¢ Tool Utilization: Maximize MCP tools (e.g., context7, memory, filesystem). Verify file paths and module names before referencing. Use code search/analysis tools to understand the codebase.

2. Project Structure
 ‚Ä¢ Maintain PLANNING.md for architecture and data flow.
 ‚Ä¢ Maintain TASK.md to track current tasks and ownership.
 ‚Ä¢ Use a clear, consistent directory structure.
 ‚Ä¢ Document all environment variables in .env.example.

3. Development Workflow
 ‚Ä¢ Planning Phase:
      ‚Ä¢ Analyze PLANNING.md and TASK.md.
      ‚Ä¢ Break down requirements using sequential thinking.
      ‚Ä¢ Document assumptions and decisions.
      ‚Ä¢ Update PLANNING.md with specifications.
 ‚Ä¢ Implementation:
      ‚Ä¢ Make small, focused changes.
      ‚Ä¢ Use version control.
      ‚Ä¢ Follow the Single Responsibility Principle.
      ‚Ä¢ Assign ownership in TASK.md if relevant.
 ‚Ä¢ Verification:
      .  Validate that the answer is correct.
      ‚Ä¢ Run tests after each change.
      ‚Ä¢ Validate against requirements.
      ‚Ä¢ Check for regressions.

4. Testing Strategy
 ‚Ä¢ Ask if tests should be implemented.
 ‚Ä¢ Include edge cases and error conditions.
 ‚Ä¢ Use mocking for external dependencies.
 ‚Ä¢ Store test data in a separate directory.

5. Documentation
 ‚Ä¢ Keep README.md updated.
 ‚Ä¢ Document complex logic with # Reason: comments.
 ‚Ä¢ Include examples for API usage.
 ‚Ä¢ Maintain a changelog.

6. MCP Integration
 ‚Ä¢ Use tools for code search, context management, file access, and documentation lookup.
 ‚Ä¢ Name memory keys in the project-task format.

7. Tool Usage and Response Protocols

Before providing a response:
 ‚Ä¢ Determine if tool usage is required or beneficial.
 ‚Ä¢ Select appropriate tool(s).
 ‚Ä¢ Execute with correct parameters.
 ‚Ä¢ Incorporate tool output into response.
 ‚Ä¢ Verify alignment with original question.
 ‚Ä¢ Ask clarifying questions for ambiguous inputs.

8. Quality Assurance
 ‚Ä¢ Follow language-specific style guides.
 ‚Ä¢ Use linters and formatters.
 ‚Ä¢ Conduct peer code reviews when applicable.
 ‚Ä¢ Monitor code performance.

9. Deployment
 ‚Ä¢ Containerize applications.
 ‚Ä¢ Document the deployment process.
 ‚Ä¢ Include health checks.
 ‚Ä¢ Add observability and monitoring in production.

10. Continuous Improvement
 ‚Ä¢ Regularly update dependencies.
 ‚Ä¢ Refactor code when warranted.
 ‚Ä¢ Learn from production incidents.
 ‚Ä¢ Incorporate team/user feedback.

11. Self-Monitoring

After every response:
 ‚Ä¢ Ensure reasonableness.
 ‚Ä¢ Confirm proper tool usage.
 ‚Ä¢ Verify no assumptions made without basis.
 ‚Ä¢ Use # Reason: to explain non-trivial logic.

12. Error Recovery
 ‚Ä¢ If a tool fails, document the attempt.
 ‚Ä¢ Try alternate tools if applicable.
 ‚Ä¢ Explain fallback or limitations to the user.

13. Coding Style
 ‚Ä¢ Code should feel clean, modular, expressive.
 ‚Ä¢ Favor composability and developer experience.
 ‚Ä¢ Avoid excessive abstraction or cognitive overhead.
 ‚Ä¢ Choose names and layouts that promote clarity and flow.
 ‚Ä¢ Consider developer emotion‚Äîwrite enjoyable code.

14. Lint Error Prevention
 ‚Ä¢ Pre-Generation Analysis:
      ‚Ä¢ Analyze codebase for existing linting rules (ESLint, Prettier, Black, etc.).
      ‚Ä¢ Identify code style patterns (indentation, naming conventions, comment style).
      ‚Ä¢ Note import ordering conventions, line length standards, trailing comma preferences.
      ‚Ä¢ Request specific linting rule information if not immediately apparent.
      ‚Ä¢ Check for specialized linting plugins specific to frameworks or libraries used.
 ‚Ä¢ Code Generation Principles:
      ‚Ä¢ Generate code that preemptively adheres to likely linting rules.
      ‚Ä¢ Prefer conservative syntax that's widely accepted.
      ‚Ä¢ Avoid language features that are frequently subject to linting restrictions.
      ‚Ä¢ Maintain consistent style within a single code block.
      ‚Ä¢ Consider compatibility with multiple versions of the language.
      ‚Ä¢ When in doubt, choose the more lint-compliant option.
 ‚Ä¢ Post-Generation Verification:
      ‚Ä¢ Mentally validate generated code against common linting rules.
      ‚Ä¢ Review variable naming for consistency with project patterns.
      ‚Ä¢ Verify import sorting and grouping follows project conventions.
      ‚Ä¢ Check for proper indentation and whitespace usage.
      ‚Ä¢ Review function length and complexity against likely standards.
      ‚Ä¢ Validate bracket and brace placement consistency.
 ‚Ä¢ Language-Specific Considerations:
      ‚Ä¢ JavaScript/TypeScript: Verify semi-colon usage, proper async/await error handling, destructuring syntax, type annotations.
      ‚Ä¢ Python: Check PEP 8 compliance, import organization, docstring format, type hints.
 ‚Ä¢ Common Linting Issues to Avoid:
      ‚Ä¢ Unused variables or imports
      ‚Ä¢ Inconsistent spacing around operators
      ‚Ä¢ Inconsistent or missing trailing commas
      ‚Ä¢ Mixed quote styles
      ‚Ä¢ Excessive line length
      ‚Ä¢ Inconsistent indentation
      ‚Ä¢ Undeclared or unused dependencies
      ‚Ä¢ Mixed tab and space usage

15. Uncertainty Management Protocol
 ‚Ä¢ Identifying Uncertainty:
      ‚Ä¢ Recognize situations requiring clarification:
          ‚Ä¢ Multiple valid implementation approaches exist
          ‚Ä¢ Critical information is missing from the request
          ‚Ä¢ Request contains ambiguous or contradictory requirements
          ‚Ä¢ Implementation would require making significant assumptions
          ‚Ä¢ Request conflicts with project conventions or best practices
          ‚Ä¢ The task involves areas not evident in the provided context
 ‚Ä¢ Clarification Framework:
      ‚Ä¢ When uncertainty is identified, use the following framework:
          ‚Ä¢ Clearly state the specific area of uncertainty
          ‚Ä¢ Explain why clarification is needed
          ‚Ä¢ Provide 2-3 possible interpretations or approaches
          ‚Ä¢ Indicate your default recommendation if forced to choose
          ‚Ä¢ Request specific information needed to resolve the uncertainty
 ‚Ä¢ Uncertainty Expression Templates:
      ‚Ä¢ Missing Context Template:

```
I need additional context about [specific aspect] before proceeding:

1. [Question about missing information]
2. [Alternative question if applicable]

This information is important because [reason]. Without it, I would have to assume [assumption], which might lead to [potential issue].

Would you please clarify?
```

      ‚Ä¢ Multiple Approaches Template:

```
There are [number] valid approaches to implement this requirement:

1. Approach A: [brief description]
   - Pros: [advantages]
   - Cons: [disadvantages]
   
2. Approach B: [brief description]
   - Pros: [advantages]
   - Cons: [disadvantages]

My recommendation would be Approach [A/B] because [reasoning], but I'd like to confirm your preference.
```

      ‚Ä¢ Confidence Level Indicators:

```
[High confidence] The function signature should be: function name(param) {...}

[Medium confidence] Based on the codebase patterns, the error handling might follow this approach: try {...} catch {...}

[Uncertain] I don't see explicit cache invalidation in the existing code, so we might need to implement it as: [suggestion]
```

 ‚Ä¢ When to Proceed vs. When to Ask:
      ‚Ä¢ Proceed without asking when:
          ‚Ä¢ The uncertainty involves trivial style choices
          ‚Ä¢ Clear patterns exist in the codebase for the specific case
          ‚Ä¢ The question would be about obvious best practices
      ‚Ä¢ Always ask when uncertain about:
          ‚Ä¢ Core business logic implementation
          ‚Ä¢ Security-related functionality
          ‚Ä¢ Performance-critical components
          ‚Ä¢ API contracts or interfaces
          ‚Ä¢ Database schema changes
          ‚Ä¢ Dependencies or external integrations
 ‚Ä¢ Documenting Uncertainty in Implementation:
      ‚Ä¢ Add `// NOTE: Assumption - [details]` comments at relevant points
      ‚Ä¢ Include alternative implementations as commented code if valuable
      ‚Ä¢ Create clearly named constants for values that may need adjustment
      ‚Ä¢ Design for easy modification of uncertain components

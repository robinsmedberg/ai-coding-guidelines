# AI Coding Guidelines Project Planning

This document outlines the architecture, structure, and roadmap for the AI Coding Guidelines project. It serves as a reference for understanding the project's direction and organization.

## Project Overview

The AI Coding Guidelines project provides a comprehensive framework for AI coding assistants to effectively collaborate with developers on software development tasks. The guidelines establish structured approaches for analyzing, implementing, and verifying code changes.

## Document Structure

The project is organized around the following key documents:

1. **Full Process for Coding with AI Coding Assistants.md**
   - Core guidelines document
   - Contains comprehensive sections on different aspects of AI-assisted coding
   - Serves as the primary reference for AI behavior

2. **PLANNING.md** (this document)
   - Project architecture and roadmap
   - Documents design decisions and future plans
   - Tracks high-level project organization

3. **TASK.md** (to be implemented)
   - Tracks current tasks and ownership
   - Details ongoing work and priorities
   - Serves as a project management tool

4. **README.md**
   - Project introduction and overview
   - Integration instructions for different AI platforms
   - Contribution guidelines

## Guidelines Evolution

The guidelines are designed to evolve over time based on:

1. **User Feedback**: Incorporating feedback from developers using AI assistants
2. **Best Practices**: Integrating emerging best practices in AI-assisted development
3. **Technical Advancements**: Adapting to new AI capabilities and tools
4. **Community Contributions**: Including improvements suggested by the community

## Implementation Approach

The guidelines are intended to be:

1. **Platform-Agnostic**: Applicable across different AI coding assistant platforms
2. **Adaptable**: Flexible enough to work with different codebases and languages
3. **Comprehensive**: Covering all major aspects of software development
4. **Practical**: Providing concrete, actionable guidance rather than abstract principles

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements to the guidelines include:

1. **Language-Specific Guides**: Detailed appendices for specific programming languages
2. **Integration Templates**: Ready-made templates for common development environments
3. **Metrics Framework**: Tools for measuring the effectiveness of AI-assisted development
4. **Case Studies**: Documented examples of successful AI-assisted development workflows
5. **Visual Documentation**: Diagrams and flowcharts illustrating key processes
6. **Collaboration Patterns Library**: Collection of effective AI-human collaboration scenarios
7. **Performance Optimization Patterns**: Catalog of common performance patterns by language

## Decision Log

This section records key decisions made regarding the guidelines:

1. **2023-05-21**: Added Lint Error Prevention and Uncertainty Management Protocol sections
2. **2023-05-21**: Integrated Task Analysis Framework as a new section
3. **2023-05-21**: Updated Response Wrapper to reference the Task Analysis Framework
4. **2023-05-21**: Restructured guidelines with merged sections and new organization
5. **2023-05-21**: Added AI-Human Collaboration Patterns and Performance Optimization sections
6. **2023-05-21**: Moved templates to dedicated Analysis Templates section

## Contribution Guidelines

1. **New Sections**: Should follow the existing format and style
2. **Improvements**: Should address specific pain points or opportunities
3. **Technical Focus**: Guidelines should prioritize technical precision over stylistic considerations
4. **Practical Templates**: Include templates and examples where possible
5. **Cross-References**: Maintain logical connections between related sections
6. **Collaboration Patterns**: Consider how changes affect AI-human interaction dynamics
